# Terra-Australis-Ignota

Terra Australis Ignota is a Multimedia project. The term refers to cartographic reference used during the 15th to 18th centuries, which alluded to territories about which little was known, such as Patagonia, or Antarctica, among other places. These territories were commonly attributed with fantastical and monstrous characteristics. The nature of the South America was depicted as exotic, wild, other, and, in this sense, monstrous.
